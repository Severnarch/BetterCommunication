# Versions
This file contains every BetterCommunication version and its changelog. A version being supported means it will have questions about it answered officially, while unsupported versions will not receive any more answers as it is suggested to update from there. A `❌` means the version is not supported, a `✅` means the version is supported and a `⚠️` means the version is being unsupported in the next update unless stated otherwise.
