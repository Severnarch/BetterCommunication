# BetterCommunication
BetterCommunication is a plugin made towards improvement of the Minecraft chat and its communication features. It is created by [@Severnarch](https://www.github.com/Severnarch), originally for the [VAN Minecraft Server](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/van-vanilla-anarchy-network/).

## Installation
Versions 1.1.0 and below require self-compilation where versions after 1.1.0 will have their own GitHub release. You can find a list of every version and its changelogs in the [Versions](VERSIONS.md) file.
Once you have the version JAR file, move it into the plugins folder of your server and either restart or use [PlugManX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugmanx.88135/) to load the plugin in without a restart.
